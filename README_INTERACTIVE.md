## Output

The script generates URLs that are compatible with OrpheusDL. For example:
```
https://play.qobuz.com/album/0093624932154
https://play.qobuz.com/album/0093624920137
https://play.qobuz.com/album/d7rchuzba48lc
```

These URLs can be:
1. **Used directly** with `orpheus.py [URL]`
2. **Saved to a file** and used with `download_links.sh`
3. **Added to your existing** `links.txt` file

## Integration with Batch Downloader

The generated file can be used with the existing `download_links.sh` script:

1. **Save your selections** to `links.txt` (or any filename)
2. **Run the batch downloader**:
   ```bash
   ./download_links.sh
   ```

## Requirements

- OrpheusDL properly configured
- At least one music service module installed (e.g., Qobuz)
- Python 3.6+

## Tips

- **Search Tips**: Use partial artist names for broader results
- **Quality Info**: Albums show quality information when available (e.g., `[96kHz/24bit]`)
- **Explicit Content**: Albums marked with `[E]` contain explicit content
- **Duration**: Album durations are shown when available
- **Backup**: The script offers to save your work when quitting

## Troubleshooting

- **No modules found**: Make sure you have music service modules installed in the `modules/` directory
- **Search errors**: Ensure your modules are properly configured with valid credentials
- **URL generation issues**: The script will fall back to comment placeholders if URL generation fails

## Example Workflow

1. Start the script: `./interactive_album_selector.py`
2. Choose "1. Search for artists and select albums"
3. Select "qobuz" as your module
4. Search for "Miles Davis"
5. Select the artist from results
6. Choose albums: `1 3 7 12` (select specific albums)
7. Continue searching for more artists or return to main menu
8. Choose "3. Save album list to file"
9. Save as "jazz_albums.txt"
10. Use with batch downloader: modify `download_links.sh` to use your file

Enjoy building your music collection! üéµ
